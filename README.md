# Purpose:
- use diabetes dataset to train logistic, svm and dtree regression models.
- use trained regression model to identify which ones have a better performance.

# Requirements:
- Spark installed

# Objective :
- perform steps to extract features and label and submit to a MLlib classification models.
- use different parameters and transformations on data to identify a good model.
